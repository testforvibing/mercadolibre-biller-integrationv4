About Velo-Only APIs and the SDK
You can now use the Wix JavaScript SDK instead of Velo APIs for most functionality when developing sites or building apps with Blocks. This marks the beginning of a gradual transition from using Velo APIs to using the next generation SDK. You are encouraged to start using the SDK in all new and ongoing development projects.

Learn more: To learn more about using the SDK for site development, see About Using the SDK or watch our video on using the SDK in the site editor.
While most Velo APIs have SDK equivalents, the ones listed in this section do not currently exist in the SDK. If you want to implement features that rely on the functionality of these Velo-Only APIs when using the SDK, continue to use the existing Velo APIs.

The APIs listed in this section will continue to function unchanged. This means you can't install npm packages to use these APIs with the SDK. Instead, import and use them as described in this reference whenever necessary.
